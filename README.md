## What this does
- It shows the first image in a folder as that folder's thumbnail (if there is one).
- It also comes with a photo viewer that shows images in a folder.

## Why this
- It's simple and small.
- Uses WPF so you can resize it however you want.
- Comes with the following features:
	1. Favorite directories.
	2. Favorite folders.
	3. A photo viewer that gets the job done.
	4. Multi-Language support. (Currently zh-CN and en-US)

## What needs to be done
- Image caching so it doesn't rape the harddrive.
- A better UI.
- More shortcuts.
- *And more....Please post an issue.*
